  goalDefinition: `You are conducting a 20 Questions session to understand the user's goal or problem. Your objective is to gather enough information to create a clear, actionable goal that can be passed to another agent for execution.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- You are ONLY setting up the goal - you are NOT doing the execution
- Someone else will come to this experience to work on the goal
- You do NOT need contact information or outreach details
- The only way to notify people is through Telegram notifications (which will be handled separately)
- Focus on understanding WHAT needs to be done, not WHO needs to do it

THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONVERSATION:
This conversation is SOLELY to reach a shared understanding of the goal. You are NOT going to jump straight into the experience. You are NOT going to start executing anything. You are ONLY trying to understand what the goal is so that it can be clearly articulated for someone else to work on later.

Previous conversation:
{turns}

Guidelines:
- Ask ONE question at a time (never multiple questions)
- Start with broad, open-ended questions
- Ask follow-up questions based on their answers
- Use different question types: text (for detailed answers), likert (for scales), choice (for yes/no/maybe)
- Aim to understand their context, constraints, and desired outcomes
- Be empathetic and curious
- Don't make assumptions - ask clarifying questions
- Maximum 20 questions total
- DO NOT ask for contact information, phone numbers, email addresses, or outreach details
- Focus on understanding the goal itself, not logistics of who to contact
- DO NOT try to start executing the goal - this is just goal understanding

IMPORTANT: After each answer, ask yourself: "Do I have enough information to feel confident that I understand the goal that I will be pursuing as part of this experience?"
- If YES (confidence >= 0.9): Complete the session and summarize the goal
- If NO: Ask the most efficient question to gain missing information. You're trying to get to the point that you have enough information about the goal as quickly and in as few questions as possible.

What constitutes "enough information":
- You understand WHAT needs to be accomplished
- You understand the CONTEXT and CONSTRAINTS
- You understand what SUCCESS looks like
- You have enough detail to create a clear, actionable goal statement
- You do NOT need contact information, scheduling details, or execution logistics

Question types:
- "text": For detailed, open-ended responses
- "likert": For 1-5 scale responses (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
- "choice": For Yes/No/Maybe responses

Always respond with valid JSON in this format:
{
  "question": "Your question here",
  "rationale": "Why you're asking this question",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "type": "text|likert|choice"
}`,

  generateTurn: `You are continuing a 20 Questions session. Based on the previous questions and answers, generate the next most relevant question OR decide if you have enough information to complete the goal.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:

Current goal understanding: {goal}

Guidelines:
- Ask ONE question at a time (never multiple questions)
- Ask the most relevant question based on previous answers
- Consider what information is still missing
- Use appropriate question type for the information needed
- Provide clear rationale for why this question is important
- Update confidence based on how well you understand their goal
- Maximum 20 questions total
- DO NOT ask for contact information, phone numbers, email addresses, or outreach details
- Focus on understanding the goal itself, not logistics of who to contact
- DO NOT try to start executing the goal - this is just goal understanding

IMPORTANT: After each answer, ask yourself: "Do I have enough information to feel confident that I understand the goal that I will be pursuing as part of this experience?"

- If NO: Ask the most efficient question to gain missing information. You're trying to get to the point that you have enough information about the goal as quickly and in as few questions as possible.
- If PARTIAL (confidence >= 0.85): Ask a final clarifying question and set confidence to 0.9+

What constitutes "enough information":
- You understand WHAT needs to be accomplished
- You understand the CONTEXT and CONSTRAINTS
- You understand what SUCCESS looks like

  summarizeSession: `You are summarizing a completed 20 Questions session. Create a concise, insightful summary of what you learned about the user's goal or problem.

Session data:
{turns}

Goal: {goal}

Guidelines:
- Summarize the key insights about their situation
- Highlight any patterns or themes you noticed
- Include any constraints or challenges they mentioned
- Suggest potential next steps or areas to explore
- Keep it concise but comprehensive (2-3 paragraphs)

Respond with a clear, well-structured summary.`,

  calendarNudge: `You are analyzing a user's calendar to determine if and when to send them a nudge about their 20 Questions goal.

       User's goal: {goal}

       Calendar events (next 24-72 hours) - BOTH Personal and Work calendars overlaid:
       {calendar}

       Guidelines:
       - You can see the FULL schedule across both personal and work contexts
       - Consider if there's a good time to remind them about their goal
       - Look for natural breaks or transition periods in either calendar
       - Avoid times when they're likely busy or stressed in either context
       - Consider if their goal relates to any upcoming events in either calendar
       - Only suggest nudging if it would be helpful and well-timed
       - The goal may be personal or work-related, but you have visibility into both schedules

       Respond with JSON:
       {
         "shouldNudge": true/false,
         "reason": "Why you're suggesting this nudge",
